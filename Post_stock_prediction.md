## Introduction

Welcome to a comprehensive exploration of Stock Return Prediction Research. In this article, we dive deep into the intricacies of predicting stock returns, encompassing data structure, descriptive analysis, missing data imputation, and an in-depth evaluation of both linear and non-linear models through the lens of back-testing. The aim is to provide a holistic understanding of the stock return prediction process.

## Part 1: How the Data Looks Like (Descriptive Analysis and Outliers)

### Data Structure Introduction

- **Y:** Represents the vector of stock returns.
- **X:** Comprises an 8-column matrix, with each column denoting a distinct stock feature.

### Descriptive Analysis

#### Y:

- When considering all data, the skewness and kurtosis of Y indicate significant deviations.
- A box plot of Y reveals the presence of outliers.
- A fat-tail distribution approach is adopted, involving the removal of data larger than the top 0.1% and smaller than the bottom 0.1%.

#### X:

- Features in X exhibit improved skewness and kurtosis compared to Y.
- Some features display high kurtosis but are retained, as feature selection methods will be employed.
- It's important to note that data rows removed from Y are also removed from X.
- A box plot of X is used to visualize the distribution of features.

#### Covariance Matrix:

- The covariance matrix analysis indicates no significant linear relationship between any two features, except for X1 and X2.
- Multicollinearity is not a primary concern, as stepwise selection methods will address this.

## Part 2: How to Deal with Missing Data Imputation

- A table displays the number of missing observations for each feature.
- Missing data imputation is performed using the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) method with an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.
- The imputation process involves using column means, grouping data into clusters using KNN, and iteratively updating cluster centers until stability is achieved or the maximum iteration limit is reached.

## Part 3: How the Performance of Back Testing from Both Linear and Non-Linear Models

- Stepwise forward feature selection methods based on adjusted R-square or user-defined score measures are used for all models.
- Two linear models are tested: classic linear regression with OLS and Elastic Net (EN) to harness L1 and L2 regularization.
- For the non-linear approach, Support Vector Machine Regression (SVM) and Multilayer Perceptron (MP) models are considered.

### Model Back-Testing

- A moving window out-sample back-testing method is employed to evaluate model performance over various time periods.
- This method allows for model adaptation to changing coefficients as time periods shift.

## Conclusion

- In the context of in-sample feature selection based on adjusted R-square, the performance of the models is evaluated.
- Linear models, especially OLS, outperform non-linear models in terms of R-square.
- The table provides fLoss, R-square, R-value, and correlation results for each model, offering insights into their effectiveness in predicting stock returns.

This research provides a comprehensive overview of stock return prediction, from data analysis to model evaluation, with the goal of aiding researchers and analysts in understanding the intricacies of this complex field.
