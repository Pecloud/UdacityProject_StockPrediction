## Descriptive Analysis

The code starts with a descriptive analysis of the provided financial data. Key steps in this section include:

- Loading the financial data.
- Descriptive analysis of the data, including statistical measures like mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis.
- Handling extreme values by removing data outside specific percentiles.
- Visualization of data using box plots.

## Missing Value Imputation

The missing value imputation process is a crucial step in preparing the data for modeling. This code employs K-means clustering to impute missing data. Steps involved in this section include:

- Loading the financial data.
- Imputing missing values using K-means clustering.
- Transformation of the data to enhance modeling results (optional).

## Model Evaluation

The model evaluation section focuses on assessing the performance of predictive models. The code provides functions to select features, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance. Key steps in this section include:

- Feature selection using forward selection methods.
- Building and training machine learning models.
- Evaluating in-sample and out-of-sample model results.
- Saving results for further analysis.
